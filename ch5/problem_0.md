## How would you describe method resolution order in the diamond pattern?
If compare the Inheritance pattern to a tree structure, I would describe method resolution order in the diamond pattern as Breadth-first search.

Because `__main__.Demeter` follows it's two superclass, `__main__.Cronus` and ` __main__.Rhea` then follow the superclass of it's two superclass,`__main__.Uranus`.
