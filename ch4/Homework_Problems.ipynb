    "Write a decorator called `maketuple` that causes the resulting function to always return a tuple. If the return value of the original function was iterable, it should be converted to a tuple explicitly and returned from the wrapped function. If the return value of the original function was not iterable, a tuple of length one with the return value should be returned from the wrapped function. The decorator should account for both positional and keyword arguments.\n",

    "Write a parameterized decorator called `accepts()` that validates the type of the each argument to a function. Each argument to `accepts` should be a type (e.g., `int` or `str`) and corresponds to the expected type of a positional argument of the wrapped function. If an argument of the wrapped function is passed an object that is not of the specified type, `TypeError` should be raised. Furthermore, if an argument passed to `accepts()` is not itself a type object, a `TypeError` should be raised at the time the wrapped function is defined! It is safe to assume that the function being decorated only accepts positional arguments.\n",

    "[Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) is an optimization technique for speeding up function calls by caching the function result for a given set of inputs. This works so long as the function is *pure*, i.e., it always returns the same result for the same arguments. The Python standard library actually includes a function decorator in the `functools` module called [lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache) that performs memoization on any function that it wraps with one twist--it only stores function results for the N most recent calls. This is called a *least recently used* (LRU) cache because the least recently used items are discarded from the function result cache if it has reached its maximum size. For this problem, you must write your own version of the `lru_cache` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lru_cache(maxsize=128)` should be a function that returns a decorator that memoizes any function it wraps using a LRU cache.\n",
    "- The `maxsize` argument determines the maximum number of entries that the cache stores and has a default value of 128.\n",
    "- The standard library version of `lru_cache` has an extra `typed` argument---you do not need to account for this argument in your version.\n",
    "- The wrapped function should have an attribute called `cache_info` that is a function that returns a [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple) storing the number of hits and misses in the cache as well as the maximum and current size of the cache. See the example below for how the `lru_cache` decorator and its `cache_info` function are used. The items in the `namedtuple` are as follows:\n",
    "    - `hits`: The number of calls to the function where the result was calculated previously and can be returned from the cache.\n",
    "    - `misses`: The number of calls to the function where the result was not previously calculated.\n",
    "    - `maxsize`: The maximum number of entries that the cache can store.\n",
    "    - `currsize`: The number of entries currently stored in the cache.\n",
    "- Use the `@functools.wraps` decorator to make sure that function metadata is copied to the wrapped function.\n",
    "- You are free to use any data structure you wish to implement the cache.\n",
    "- Your decorator should work for wrapped functions that have both positional and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",

    "...     quad = b*b - 4*a*c\n",
    "...     sqrt = cmath.sqrt if quad < 0 else math.sqrt\n",
    "...     x1 = (-b + sqrt(quad))/(2*a)\n",
    "...     x2 = (-b - sqrt(quad))/(2*a)\n",
    "...     return x1, x2\n",
